#### Start SOCKS5

The [start-socks5](start-socks5) folder contains a script for setting up a SOCKS5 proxy using SSH. The script, [`start-ssh-socks5.sh`](start-socks5/start-ssh-socks5.sh), prompts the user for necessary information, saves the settings for future use, and manages the SSH connection.
